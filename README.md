# Individual School Exam
This is a project that i made as my last individual exam in HTML and CSS. Bonz.ai is created mobilefirst with focus on seo, accesability and userexperiance. With a big yet simple navigation bar, easy to read breadcrumbs for SEO the website has an easy learningcurve from the first user interaction with the site. For structuring and layout i have used CSS grid and flexbox, aswell as making the website fully responsive for desktop, tablets and mobilescreens. BEM naming standard is being used throughout the project. The website consists of three main landing pages aswell as a three-step booking checkout. There is currently no functionallity applied to the website with JavaScript. This will be added in the future.
